Storage Backends
================

Titan's data storage layer is pluggable.  Implementations of the
pluggable storage layer -- that is, the software component tells Titan
how to talk to its data store -- are called storage backends.

This section describes configuration and administration of Titan's
standard storage backends.

This section only addresses configuration of the stock storage
backends that come with Titan.
